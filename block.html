            <h1>The difference of local storage and session storage</h1>
            <p><strong>sessionStorage</strong> is similar to <strong>localStorage</strong> ;</p>
            <p>The difference is that
                while data in <strong>localStorage</strong> doesn't
                expire, data in <strong>sessionStorage</strong> is cleared when the page session ends.</p>

            <h1>What is the Global Scope and Block scope</h1>
            <h4 style="color: tomato;">Global Scope</h4>
            <p>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>
            <h4 style="color: tomato;">Block Scope</h4>
            <p>
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
                brackets {}.

                Imagine a nested situation:
                A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{} containing some block variables.</p>

            <h1>How work the JavaScript Event Loop</h1>
            <h4 style="color: tomato;">The event loop</h4>
            <p>
                JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
                models in other languages like C and Java.

            </p>
            <h4 style="color: tomato;"> Runtime concepts</h4>
            <p>
                The following sections explain a theoretical model. Modern JavaScript engines implement and heavily
                optimize the described semantics.</p>
